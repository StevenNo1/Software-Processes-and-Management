Lecture 1: Introduction to Projects Methodologies
The reason to use a project:
A temporary endeavour to create a unique product, service or outcome.

Why organizations use projects:
Allows the organization to deliver change in a structured and formal manner outside of BAU.
Effective and efficient management of organisations limited resources.
(people and money)
Provide clarity, buy-in and agreement across what will be done, when, who, why and the outcomes.

Project management:
Project Management is the planning, delegating(委派), monitoring and controlling of all aspects of a project, and motivating those involved to achieve the project objectives within the expected targets for time, costs, quality, scope, benefits and risks.

Value lies in:
• Organising and structuring scarce(稀缺) resources
• Managing risk
• Identifying and clearing issues
• Managing and implementing change
• Retaining and re-using knowledge
• Organisational wide learning from past success and failures

Project manager skills:
Project managers are highly skilled knowledge workers and change agents. They take accountability, make project goals their own and use their skills and expertise to inspire a sense of shared purpose across the project team. They enjoy the organised adrenaline(肾上腺素) of new challenges and the responsibility of driving business results.

Core Skills / Attributes:
• Work well under pressure
• Comfortable with change and complexity in changing environments
• Use / have the right people skills
• Adapt, resolve issues and deal with problems
• Effective communicators regardless of hierarchy(等级)
• Action orientated and leave nothing for tomorrow
• Command & Control
• Good ones are in demand, hard to find and get paid a lot

Key Elements of Project Management Methodologies / Standards
Waterfall
Traditional approach, which used for 40 years
Requirement must be defined at start
Little or no alter
Sequential - complete 1 task and than the next
Pros:
Extensive planning, this thoroughness would result in more accurate timelines and budgets.
Cons:
Difficult to apply changes
Agile
Focus on change situations
Small manageable actions and activities
Customer focus over formalised sign-offs
Involvement & ownership across the team - Team members self select work

Pros:
Retains flexibility while continuing producing outcomes - less rework
Great communication and engagement - increased buy in across the team of the end outcome

Cons:
Difficult to do without experience - especially an experienced Scrum master
Large project in different locations
Difficult to contact suppliers

It is all about the money!
For an non mandatory project, the primary benefit is financial
Some techniques include:
Return on investment
Net present value
Payback period
Rough order of magnitude(project cost)
However, this is not always about the best return - organizations need to invest in other parts in their business.

ROI
ROI is income divide by investment
ROI = (total benefits - total costs)/total cost
The higher ROI % or higher the ratio of benefits to costs, the better is
Many organizations required (11%-14%)

ROI may not be appropriate  
Expenditure such as IT consumables, replacing broken PC’s
Short duration maintenance projects that can be completed in less than 1 month.
Projects that do not produce cost savings or revenue. For these ROI will be zero or negative.
Projects that are mandated for regulatory and compliance.
Projects that involve life or death. (e.g., Healthcare Solutions),
Projects which only have intangible benefits and no measurable financial benefits
Net Present Value(NPV)
NPV is a method of calculating the value of all future cash flows (positive and negative) over the entire life of an investment discounted to present.
It takes into account all avenue, expenditure, expenses, and capital costs associated with an investment.
In addition to factoring all revenues and costs and it takes into account the timing of each cash flow that can result in a large impact of the present value of an investment

NPV is one of the most often used quantitative/financial models for project selection.
Projects with a positive NPV should be considered if financial value is a key criterion.
Generally, the higher the NPV, the more favourable a project is.

Payback period
The payback period is the amount of time it takes a project before the accrued benefits surpass accrued costs or how much time an investment takes to recover its initial cost.
Many organizations want IT projects to have fairly short payback periods(<1 year) due to the changing nature of technology.

Project Cost/Estimation Rough Order of Magnitude
ROM is an estimation of a project's level of effort and cost to complete.

Lecture 2:Project Management Plan, Stakeholder Management, Communication Management
Defined Process Control:
A process with a well-defined set of steps. Given the same input, a defined process should produce the same output every time.

Given when in an environment with relatively low volatility that can be easily predictable.

Empirical Process Control:
Learn as progress
Expect and embrace change 
Inspect and adapting using short development cycle
Estimates are indicative only and may not be accurate
Project Charter V Project Management Plan:
A project charter is a summary project proposal to secure approval for the project goals and terms (useful as part of business case).

A PMP is an approved document showing how to achieve the approved project goals / benefits and provides the details on how to execute and manage the project (used as part of mobilisation and on-going management of the project).

Lecture 3: Agile, Formal
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the application development life-cycle, is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing and deploying an information system.
1.Requirement gathering
2.System / Architectural Design
3.Implementation / coding / Integration
4.Testing
5.Evolution:

SDLC type:
Formal:
Waterfall
Incremental
V-model
Agile:
Scrum
Kanban
Extreme programming

Waterfall:
Advantages:
Disadvantages:
Incremental Model:
In the incremental model the whole requirement is divided into various releases. Multiple cycles take place, making the life cycle a multi-waterfall cycle. Cycles are divided up into smaller, more easily managed modules.

When to use Formal models:
Projects where the customer has a very clear view of what they want.
Projects that will require little or no change to requirements.
Software requirements are clearly defined and documented.
Software development technologies and tools are well-known.
Large scale applications and systems developments.

Why is agile attractive?
We are in an ever changing global world with the pace of change increasing.
Customer needs and demands are exponentially increasing – products must continually be delivered.
Low Technology cost, ease of use and the global marketplace has increased competition and reduced entry barriers.
The war for talent is over – and we have lost! Cross functional teams help minimise the potential loss.
Long development cycles are like long lunches – a thing of the past.
Quality is no longer something we do / check later – it must be part of everything we do.
Cross functional groups are more fun!

What is Agile?
A framework based on iterative development where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organising cross-functional teams.
A disciplined process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation.
A leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self - organisation and accountability.
A set of engineering best practices intended to allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software.
A business approach that aligns development with customer needs and company goals.

Scrum Key Characteristics:
1.Self-organising teams.
2.Product progresses in a series of focused sprints.
3.Requirements are captured as items in a list of product backlog.
4.Scrum is one of the agile processes – the one most widely used, discussed and debated.
5.Time frame is contained to a manageable size (weeks or months)

Scrum Roles - Product owner:
Define the features of the product.
Decides on release date and content.
Is responsible for the benefits/profitability of the product(ROI)
Prioritises features according to the market value.
Adjusts features and priority every iteration, as needed.
Accepts or rejects work results.
Scrum Roles – Scrum Master:
1.Represents management to the project.
2.Responsible for enacting Scrum values and practices.
3.Removes impediments / road blocks.
4.Ensures that the team is fully functional and productive.
5.Enables close cooperation across all roles.
6.Shields the team from external interference.
7.Is a member & active participant of the Scrum Team.
Scrum Roles – The Team:
Usually 6-9 people
Cross-functional
Members should be in full time
Co-located
Product Backlog:
1.The requirements.
2.A list of all desired work on the project.
3.Ideally expressed such that each item has value to the users or customers of the product.
4.Product Backlog User Stories are selected for a Sprint by Product Owner.
5.Reprioritised(优先) at the start of each sprint.
Formal or Agile which one Should I use???
1.How Stable Are the Requirements?
2.Do the end users need to collaborate?
3.Is the Timeline Aggressive or Conservative

Lecture 5: Risk Management
What is a risk:
An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on the project objectives.
Risk vs Uncertainty:
Uncertainty:
1.Lack of complete certainty about an event/outcome.
2.The event/outcome has a probability of less than 1.
Risk:
Uncertainty that has an impact.

Why formal risk management:
Project have many possible risks, that could have significant impact on the outcomes:
Business risks
Project risks
Product risks

The goal of project risk management is to:
Minimising the impact of potential negative risks while maximizing the impact of potential positive risks.

Risk Management Process:
Plan
Identify
Analyse and Access (Qualitative and Quantitative)
Respond (Action)
Monitor and Control

Risk Management Planning:
The output of risk management planning is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that documents the procedures for managing risks throughout a project.

The Risk Management Plan Template:
Methodology
Roles and Responsibilities
Budget and Schedule
Risk Categories
Risk Probability and Impact
Tracking
Risk Documentation
Contingency Plans
Fall-back Plans
Kinds of Risk:
Project risks
Product risks
Business risks
Risk Identification:
Deals with using a systematic approach for identifying and creating a list of threats and opportunities that may impact the project’s goals.

Risk identification techniques:
Pondering(思考)
Interviewing
Brainstorming
Checklists
Delphi Technique
SWOT Analysis

Risk Analysis
Identify each identified risk’s probability and impact.

important steps of risk analysis are:
1.Estimating the risk probability(P)
This is an estimation of the probability that the risk will occur.
2.Estimating the risk impact(I):
Usually measured in a scale of 1-5

Compute risk exposure (or P *I Score):
Risk exposure = risk probability(P) * risk impact(I)
Risk Assessment:
Prioritize risks so that an effective risk strategy can be formulated.
Risk matrix - define the level of risk by considering the probability or likelihood consequence severity.

Common Techniques:
1.Decision Tree Analysis
2.Simulation
3.Sensitivity Analysis

Risk Response Strategies:
Four common strategies to handle threats:
1.Accept or Ignore
2.Avoid
3.Mitigate
4.Transfer

Four common strategies to handle opportunities:
1.Exploit(利用)
2.Enhance
3.Share
4.Accept

Tools for monitoring and controlling:
Risk Audits
Risk Reviews
Risk status meetings

Lecture 6: Project Scheduling

What does the project schedule contain?
1.Duration and dependencies for each task
2.People and physical resources required by each task
3.Milestones and deliverables
4.Project Timeline

Developing Project Schedule:
1.Breakdown the task into small chunks you can deal with – Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
2.Identify the interdependencies between the broken down tasks and develop a task network
3.Estimate the effort and the time allocation for each task
4.Allocate resources for tasks and validate effort
5.Develop the project schedule

Task can be:
Unconstrained: task can start at any time
Constrained: depends on another task


Dependency
Description
Representation
Finish-to-Start
Predecessor must finish before Successor can start

Start-to-Start
Predecessor must start before Successor can start

Finish-to-Finish
Predecessor must finish before the Successor can Finish

Start-to-Finish
Predecessor must start before the Successor can finish


Person-months:
the time in months for a single person working full time to complete the task.

Time Estimation:
Terminology
optimistic time - O
pessimistic time - P
most likely time - M
expected time - TE

TE = (O + 4M + P)/6

Resource Allocation:
If the effort (person-months) and the time are known, the number of personnel can be computed as:
N = Effort/T

Project Schedule:
Two widely used graphical notations to represent the Project Schedule:
Gantt charts:
A bar chart that shows the schedule against a calendar.

PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts:
An activity network that shows the dependencies among tasks and the critical path.

Critical Path Methods:
Critical Path:
path with the longest duration
activities on the critical path have a total free slack of 0
a delay in any of the activities in the critical path will cause the project to delay.

Crashing the project schedule:
shortening the total duration of the project by shortening the critical path.

Planned Value (PV):
The Earned Value (EV):
Actual Cost (AC):

Schedule Variance: expressed in dollars
SV = EV - PV

Schedule Performance Index: expressed as a fraction
SPI = EV/PV

Cost Variance: expressed in dollars
CV = EV - AC

Cost Performance Index: expressed as a fraction
CPI = EV/AC

Assumptions in Formal Planning:
Scope fixed – requirements are stable
Budget fixed – cost estimates are accurate
Schedule fixed - derived based on scope and budget
Agile Planning:
Fix date and budget and have the scope flexible
Fixed-Date release planning
Fix scope and have the date and budget flexible
Fixed-Scope release planning

Lecture 7: Cost Estimation

Computing Count Total:
FP = count total × (0.65 + 0.01 × Fi(all level Fi))

Fi - VAF corresponding to the i-th VAF question

Techniques for cost estimation:
Effort = A × SizeB × M
A - a constant factor that depends on the organizational practices
Size - size of the software estimated in a metric of choice (e.g. lines of code, function point, use case points)
B - a value between 1 and 1.5 derived experimentally
M − a multiplier made by combining process, product and development attributes such as stability of requirement, experience of the team

Basic steps in algorithmic cost estimation:
1. Estimate the size of the development product
2. Estimate the effort in person-months or person-hours
3. Estimate the schedule in calendar months
4. Estimate the project cost in agreed currency
Software Size Estimation:
Source Lines of Code (SLOC):
Based on code
Function Points (FP):
Based on the Requirements Specification
Use-case Points (UCP):
Based on Use Cases

Physical SLOC
Logical SLOC

Use Case Points(UCP) Computation:
1.Unadjusted Use Case Weight (UUCW):
Ns, NA, Nc based on the number of transactions as per table below.
The number of transactions can be computed by counting the number of steps in the scenario.

UUCW = Ns × 5 + NA × 10 + Nc × 15


2.Compute Unadjusted Actor Weight (UAW):
Count the number of simple average, complex actors, Ns, NA, NC as per table below.

3.Compute Technical Complexity Factor (TCF):

TCF = 0.6 + TF/100

4.Compute Environmental Complexity Factor (ECF):

ECF = 1.4 + (−.03 ∗ EF)
5.Compute the final size estimate:
UCP = UUCW + UAW × TCF × ECF

COCOMO II – Early Design Model:
Estimating Effort:
Effort = A × SizeB × M
Estimating Time (T) and Number of Personnel (N):
Formula for estimating the nominal delivery time:

Agile Effort Estimation:
Story points: a story point is a relative measure of the size of a user story (recall that the requirements of the system are documented using user stories)
Velocity: velocity is a measure of productivity of a team, which is represented by the number of story points delivered in a specified time period.

Agile Estimation Techniques:
1.Planning Poker
2.Bucket System
3.Relative Mass Valuation
4.T-Shirt Sizes
5.Affinity Estimation
6.Dot Voting

Computing Velocity:
V =SP/Ti


Estimated Delivery Time:


Lecture 8: Quality Management
Quality Assurance:
The establishment of a framework of organizational procedures and standards that lead to high-quality software.
Quality assurance process is primarily concerned with defining or selecting the quality standards.
There are two types of standards:
Product standards:
These apply to the product being developed

Process standards:
These standards define the processes that should be followed
during software development

Capability Maturity Model:
Level 1:Initial

Processes unpredictable, poorly controlled and reactive

Level 2:
Managed

Processes characterized for projects and often reactive

Level 3:
Defined

Processes characterized for the organization and is proactive (project tailor their processes from organization’s standard)

Level 4:
Quantitatively managed

Process measured and controlled

Level 5:
Optimizing

Focus on process improvement

Quality planning:
The process of selecting those standards and systems that are appropriate to a particular organization and project.
The outcome of the planning process is a:
Software Quality Plan (SQP), sometimes called a Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP)

Software Quality Assurance Plan:
Product Overview
Product Plan
Quality Goals
Process Description
Document and Coding Standards
Risks and Risk Management

Review
Review is a common technique used for verification and validation.

Three common types of reviews:
1.Technical Reviews
2.Business Reviews
3.Management Reviews

Advantage of technical reviews:
1.Can be transformed on any software artefact
2.Earlier detection of problem
3.review find the actual faults in source code
4.due to internal pressure of getting software releases out the door, programmers make more mistakes when correcting the faults that were found during testing than they do correcting faults during review phrase.
Disadvantages of technical reviews:
1.could be time and resource consuming.
2.should be carefully planned and executed to get the desired outcomes.
Types of technical reviews:
1.Informal Reviews
2.Formal Reviews
3.Walk throughs
4.Code inspections
5.Audits

Tutorial 8:
What are the advantages of moving a software process from “repeatable” to “defined” ? answer:C
a) A defined software process has measurement and control processes in place to encourage good management of the project.
b) Less costly on the project team
c) It enables less experienced managers to perform as well as highly experienced managers.
d) Good for team morale
What are the disadvantages of moving a software process from “repeatable” to “defined” ? (choose all that are correct) answer: B and D
a) It is difficult to manage because there are fewer guidelines
b) Expensive
c) It does not provide opportunities for junior managers to gain skills
d) Can be problematic for team morale and interpersonal relationships
Lecture 9:
Ethics:
Australian Computer Society Code Of Ethics
Outsourcing:
What is Outsourcing? The practice of engaging an external party (under contract) to perform services or create goods that are traditionally performed in-house by the company's own employees.

Types of Outsourcing:
Onshoring
Nearshoring
Offshoring

Procurement(采购流程):
The Procurement Management Process consists of 3 broad stages:
1. Plan.
2. Source.
3. Manage.

Request For X (RFx):
x = Bid, Information, Proposal, Tender or Quote.
Statement of Work(SOW):
A key component of the RFx document is to analyse the business needs and establish a detailed Statement of Work (SOW).

Contracts:
Contracts are the one source of truth for all activities that are to be delivered by the external parties.
Fixed Price contract:
Time & Material contract:




Lecture 10: Configuration Management

The aim of configuration management is to manage change properly without losing overall consistency through.

Configuration Management aims:
1.To identify all items that collectively will make up the configuration.
2.To manage changes to one or more of these items so that the collection remains consistent.
3.To manage different versions of the product.
4.To assure software quality as the configuration evolves over time.

Configuration Tasks:
Identification:
the configuration items necessary for the project are identified
Version control:
processes and tools are chosen to manage the different versions of configuration items as they are developed.

Version: An instance of a model, document, code, or other configuration item which is functionally distinct in some way from other system instances.
Variant: An instance of a system which is functionally identical but non-functionally distinct from other instances of a system.
Release: An instance of a system which is distributed to users outside of the development team.


Each change should record:
1.the change made
2.the rationale for the change
3.who made the change
4.when it was implemented

Change control:
changes that affect more than just one configuration item are managed
Configuration auditing:
the consistency of the configuration is checked
Configuration reporting:
the status of configuration items is reported

Lecture 12(final revision):
